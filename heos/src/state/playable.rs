/// Abstraction around anything stateful that can play music.
///
/// A "playable" is considered to be anything that can play music or otherwise has music "controls",
/// such as volume, next/prev, etc. A [player](super::player) is obviously a playable, but so is a
/// [group](super::group), since a group can play and control music as a group.
///
/// For example, when a playable is a group, many aspects of the playable - such as the queue and
/// repeat/shuffle modes - are simply retrieved from the group's leader, while some aspects that a
/// group controls - such as the volume - are retrieved from the group itself.
