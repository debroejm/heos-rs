/// # Getting a Connection
///
/// A HEOS system on the local network can be found via SSDP discovery. The following initiates SSDP
/// discovery and yields an asynchronous stream of possible HEOS connection endpoints as they're
/// discovered:
///
/// ```
/// use heos::HeosConnection;
/// # use heos::{Created, ScanError};
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// # use tokio_stream::Stream;
///
/// # async fn wrapper() -> Result<impl Stream<Item=HeosConnection<Created>>, ScanError> {
/// let endpoints = HeosConnection::scan(Duration::from_secs(10)).await?;
/// # Ok(endpoints)
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Once endpoints have been discovered, any of them can be chosen to be used as the connection. The
/// HEOS CLI uses a distributed system where a connection to any HEOS device can control all HEOS
/// devices on the same network.
///
/// ```
/// use heos::{ConnectError, HeosConnection};
/// # use heos::AdHoc;
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use tokio_stream::StreamExt;
///
/// # async fn wrapper() -> Result<HeosConnection<AdHoc>, ConnectError> {
/// let mut endpoints = HeosConnection::scan(Duration::from_secs(10)).await?;
/// let connection = endpoints.next().await
///     .ok_or(ConnectError::NoDevicesFound)?
///     .connect().await?;
/// # Ok(connection)
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Or, to do all of the above in one method:
///
/// ```
/// use heos::HeosConnection;
/// # use heos::{AdHoc, ConnectError};
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// # async fn wrapper() -> Result<HeosConnection<AdHoc>, ConnectError> {
/// let connection = HeosConnection::connect_any(Duration::from_secs(10)).await?;
/// # Ok(connection)
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Stateful Connections
///
/// The HEOS system supports sending change events whenever any part of the internal state changes.
/// Using these, we can maintain a stateful representation of the system without needing to re-query
/// all the time.
///
/// A stateful connection can be initiated like so:
///
/// ```
/// use heos::HeosConnection;
/// # use heos::{Stateful, ConnectError};
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// # async fn wrapper() -> Result<HeosConnection<Stateful>, ConnectError> {
/// let connection = HeosConnection::connect_any(Duration::from_secs(10)).await?;
/// let stateful = connection.init_stateful().await?;
/// # Ok(stateful)
/// # }
/// ```
